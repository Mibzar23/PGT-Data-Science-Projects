# Linear and Discrete Optimisation Final Project :chart_with_upwards_trend:

This project tackles a variation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Linear Programming. While the standard textbook solution required a two-step process with iterative human intervention, I developed a fully automated approach that optimizes both objective functions simultaneously via a trade-off mechanism.

- :white_check_mark: **Key Highlights** 

  - Automated Optimality: Unlike the reference solution, this model requires no manual intervention beyond the initial setup of locations and travel times.
  - Pure LP Formulation: The model relies exclusively on linear programming techniques to ensure robust and globally optimal solutions.

- :memo: **Files** 

  - Excel: Designed for structural clarity and rapid solving times.
     -  Download the file "*cw-lost_bagagge_vrp.xlsx*".
     -  Requires *OpenSolver* add-in.
  - LP-Solve IDE: Demonstrates a rigorous understanding of linear algebra by replicating the Excel formulation using explicit linear equations.
