# Statistical Machine Learning: A Methodological Investigation of Spectral Clustering in Machine Learning :cyclone:

This project presents a statistical approach to understanding the foundations of **Spectral Clustering** as an unsupervised learning method. The final deliverables for this module included not only the source code but also a formal presentation and a written report (available privately with permission from the authors).

The investigation is divided into four key phases:
  1. An investigation into the fundamentals and limitations of linear methods, specifically K-Means.
  2. An in-depth analysis of the graph theory behind spectral clustering, its practical application, and a comparative performance analysis against K-Means.
  3. The implementation of advanced methods to address complex, real-world data structures.
  4. Performance evaluation in a complex, near real-world scenario.
